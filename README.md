ðŸŒ¿ Description:
This is a Plant Disease Detection system powered by an AI Engine. The application helps in detecting diseases from images of various fruits and vegetables. Users can click on images or use the interface to interact with the AI engine to perform analysis.
Technologies Likely Used:
1. Frontend:
HTML/CSS: For structure and styling.

JavaScript: For interactivity (button clicks, image handling).

2. Backend (AI Engine):
Python (Flask or Django): Common for deploying ML models and serving web apps.

TensorFlow / PyTorch: For the AI model that detects plant diseases.

OpenCV or PIL: For image preprocessing.
